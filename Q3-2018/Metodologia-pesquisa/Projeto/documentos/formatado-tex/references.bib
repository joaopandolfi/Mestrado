abstract = {MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEMS automatically learn programs from data. This is often a very attractive alternative to manually constructing them, and in the last decade the use of machine learning has spread rapidly throughout computer science and beyond. Machine learning is used in Web search, spam filters, recommender systems, ad placement, credit scoring, fraud detection, stock trading, drug design, and many other applications. A recent report from the McKinsey Global Institute asserts that machine learning (a.k.a. data mining or predictive analytics) will be the driver of the next big wave of innovation. Several fine textbooks are available to interested practitioners and researchers (for example, Mitchell and Witten et al.). However, much of the “folk knowledge” that is needed to successfully develop machine learning applications is not readily available in them. As a result, many machine learning projects take much longer than necessary or wind up producing less-than-ideal results. Yet much of this folk knowledge is fairly easy to communicate. This is the purpose of this article.},

abstract = {The quality of discovered knowledge is highly depending on data quality. Unfortunately real data use to contain noise, uncertainty, errors, redundancies or even irrelevant information. The more complex is the reality to be analyzed, the higher the risk of getting low quality data. Knowledge Discovery from Databases (KDD) offers a global framework to prepare data in the right form to perform correct analyses. On the other hand, the quality of decisions taken upon KDD results, depend not only on the quality of the results themselves, but on the capacity of the system to communicate those results in an understandable form. Environmental systems are particularly complex and environmental users particularly require clarity in their results. In this paper some details about how this can be achieved are provided. The role of the pre and post processing in the whole process of Knowledge Discovery in environmental systems is discussed.},

abstract = {Malaria is one of the world's most common and serious tropical diseases, caused by parasites of the genus plasmodia that are transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes. Various parts of Asia and Latin America are affected but highest malaria incidence is found in Sub-Saharan Africa. Standard diagnosis of malaria comprises microscopic detection of parasites in stained thick and thin blood films. As the process of slide reading under the microscope is an error-prone and tedious issue we are developing computer-assisted microscopy systems to support detection and diagnosis of malaria. In this paper we focus on a deep learning (DL) approach for the detection of plasmodia and the evaluation of the proposed approach in comparison with two reference approaches. The proposed classification schemes have been evaluated with more than 180,000 automatically detected and manually classified plasmodia candidate objects from so-called thick smears. Automated solutions for the morphological analysis of malaria blood films could apply such a classifier to detect plasmodia in the highly complex image data of thick smears and thereby shortening the examination time. With such a system diagnosis of malaria infections should become a less tedious, more reliable and reproducible and thus a more objective process. Better quality assurance, improved documentation and global data availability are additional benefits. {\textcopyright} 2017 SPIE.},

abstract = {Automatic insect recognition (AIR), using noninvasive meth-ods in situ, has far-reaching implications in entomology, agriculture, and disease control and prevention. An emerging technology in computational entomology uses flight informa-tion captured by laser sensors. Current methods treat these optical signals as static patterns, rather than time series. We propose a novel approach to AIR by evaluating each insect passage as a nonstationary process involving a sequence of pseudo-acoustic frames and modeling the short-term flight dynamics using the kernel adaptive autoregressive-moving average (KAARMA) algorithm. Since flight behavior is both nonlinear and nonstationary in nature, dynamic modeling provides a general framework that fully exploits the transi-tional and contextual information. Results show KAARMA classifier outperforms the state-of-the-art AIR methods, using support vector machine (SYM), deep-learning autoencoder, and batch learning, in identifying Zika vector mosquito Aedes aegypti among five species of flying insects, while using sig-nificantly more efficient data representation.},

Previous studies on the classification of LS, typically classifyLS based on the description of the LS preference itself without giving attention to the student preferences.This study presents a new knowledge in classifying learning material based on learning style. In this paper, we propose Elman Neural Network (ENN) trained by using Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) (ABCENN) to create a classifier for the classification of LS (Diverging, Accommodating, Converging, and Assimilating) based on student preference of teaching strategies (TS) and LO. Our research extends on ourprevious work which considered only LO without TS. For the purpose of comparison, hybrid of ABC and backpropagation neural network (ABCBPNN) and ENN were applied to classify the LS of learners. Simulation results indicated that the propose ABCENN classifier outperforms ABCBPNN, and ENN classifiers with an accuracy of 97.12{\%} and converges faster than the comparison methods. The propose ABCENN of this research can offer valuable information for educators, school administrators, and researchers to reach a decision on their respective students and to appropriately adapt their teaching methods.This in turn can significantly improve learners performance in understanding the subject matter. {\textcopyright} 2017 NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor.},

abstract = {Insects have a close relationship with the humanity, in both positive and negative ways. Mosquito borne diseases kill millions of people and insect pests consume and destroy around US {\$}40 billion worth of food each year. In contrast, insects pollinate at least two-thirds of all the food consumed in the world. In order to control populations of disease vectors and agricultural pests, researchers in entomology have developed numerous methods including chemical, biological and mechanical approaches. However, without the knowledge of the exact location of the insects, the use of these techniques becomes costly and inefficient. We are developing a novel sensor as a tool to control disease vectors and agricultural pests. This sensor, which is built from inexpensive commodity electronics, captures insect flight information using laser light and classifies the insects according to their species. The use of machine learning techniques allows the sensor to automatically identify the species without human intervention. Finally, the sensor can provide real-time estimates of insect species with virtually no time gap between the insect identification and the delivery of population estimates. In this paper, we present our solution to the most important challenge to make this sensor practical: the creation of an accurate classification system. We show that, with the correct combination of feature extraction and machine learning techniques, we can achieve an accuracy of almost 90 {\%} in the task of identifying the correct insect species among nine species. Specifically, we show that we can achieve an accuracy of 95 {\%} in the task of correctly recognizing if a given event was generated by a disease vector mosquito.},

Given this, the last sixty years have seen many research efforts devoted to this task. To date, however, none of this research has had a lasting impact. In this work, we show that pseudo-acoustic optical sensors can produce superior data; that additional features, both intrinsic and extrinsic to the insect's flight behavior, can be exploited to improve insect classification; that a Bayesian classification approach allows to efficiently learn classification models that are very robust to over-fitting, and a general classification framework allows to easily incorporate arbitrary number of features.

Recent advances have enabled geometric techniques to be applied to many zoological problems, particularly those involving epidemiologically-relevant mosquitoes. Herein, we briefly introduce geometric morphometric (GM) techniques and then review selected groups of mosquitoes (Culicidae) to which those techniques have been applied. In most of the reviewed cases, GM was capable of satisfactorily discriminating among the tested groups primarily when the studies considered differences within and among species, sexual dimorphism, treatments and the separation of laboratory strains. Although GM approaches have developed quite rapidly, some caution must be taken during data processing for a reliable biometrical approach, such as allometry and asymmetry analyses, scale removal and wing clarification staining for landmark digitization. We also critically forecast directions in this field and discuss how the creation of image databases should enhance species identification in culicids.},

Microscopists commonly examine thick and thin blood smears to diagnose disease and compute parasitemia. However, their accuracy depends on smear quality and expertise in classifying and counting parasitized and uninfected cells. Such an examination could be arduous for large-scale diagnoses resulting in poor quality. State-of-the-art image-analysis based computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) methods using machine learning (ML) techniques, applied to microscopic images of the smears using hand-engineered features demand expertise in analyzing morphological, textural, and positional variations of the region of interest (ROI). In contrast, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a class of deep learning (DL) models promise highly scalable and superior results with end-to-end feature extraction and classification. Automated malaria screening using DL techniques could, therefore, serve as an effective diagnostic aid. In this study, we evaluate the performance of pre-trained CNN based DL models as feature extractors toward classifying parasitized and uninfected cells to aid in improved disease screening. We experimentally determine the optimal model layers for feature extraction from the underlying data. Statistical validation of the results demonstrates the use of pre-trained CNNs as a promising tool for feature extraction for this purpose. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The significant feature of HANS is that when an unknown sequence is presented to the system, it first classifies the genera to which the sequence corresponds and then proceeds with the same sequence information to identify the species of the respective genera.

The results demonstrate the efficiency of the neural network models to extract the genetic information in ITS2 sequences and to adapt to new data. The method of MISONN is found to exhibit superior performance over MIMONN in distinguishing and identification of the mosquito vectors. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We developed an automatic mosquito classification system which consists of an infrared recording device for profiling the wingbeat of the in-flight mosquito species and a machine learning model for classifying the gender, genus, and species of the incoming mosquitoes by the signatures of their wingbeats.The recording device is a set of infrared emitters and receivers, which are attached to the wall of an apparatus. When the winged subject enters the apparatus, its flapping wings block the infrared beam from the emitters intermittently such that the receivers convert the wingbeat to the electrical waveform. To classify the incoming subjects, we proposed a machine learning method, which is the Gaussian mixture model trained using the expectation-maximization algorithm (EM-GMM), and compared it with the previously proposed algorithms, including the artificial neuron network model (ANN) and the nearest neighbor model.To assess the performance of the system, we used the living male and female Aedes albopictus, Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus. The results show that the accuracies of the proposed system are above 80{\%} on identifying the gender and genus of the mosquitoes, with the precisions above 80{\%} and 70{\%}, respectively. The results also suggest that the EM-GMM algorithm outperforms the other two algorithms on the accuracy and precision of the classification of the classes of mosquitoes. In addition to the evaluation of the performance of the system, we also found that certain classes of mosquitoes share similar wingbeat characteristics, which implies that the distinctive wingbeat characteristics should be considered for the optimal accuracy of the classification of the insects of interest.},

We have constructed a program as the integral part of an automated system to identify insects based on wing outlines (DAIIS). This program includes two main functions: (1) outline digitization and Elliptic Fourier transformation and (2) classifier model training by pattern recognition of support vector machines and model validation. To demonstrate the utility of this program, a sample of 120 owlflies (Neuroptera: Ascalaphidae) was split into training and validation sets. After training, the sample was sorted into seven species using this tool. In five repeated experiments, the mean accuracy for identification of each species ranged from 90{\%} to 98{\%}. The accuracy increased to 99{\%} when the samples were first divided into two groups based on features of their compound eyes. DAIIS can therefore be a useful tool for developing a system of automated insect identification.},

Correct identification of mosquito species is an essential step in the development of effective control strategies for these diseases; recognizing the vectors of pathogens is integral to understanding transmission. Unfortunately, taxonomic identification of mosquitoes is a laborious task, which requires trained experts, and it is jeopardized by the high variability of morphological and molecular characters found within the Culicidae family. In this context, the development of an automatized species identification method would be a valuable and more accessible resource to non-taxonomist and health professionals.

We tested the hypothesis that classification using ANN is better than traditional classification by discriminant analysis (DA). Thirty-two wing shape principal components were used as input to a Multilayer Perceptron Classification ANN. The obtained ANN correctly identified species with accuracy rates ranging from 85.70{\%} to 100{\%}, and classified species more efficiently than did the traditional method of multivariate discriminant analysis. The results highlight the power of ANNs to diagnose mosquito species and to partly automatize taxonomic identification.

abstract = {The need for a novel automated mosquito perception and classification method is becoming increasingly essential in recent years, with steeply increasing number of mosquito-borne diseases and associated casualties. There exist remote sensing and GIS-based methods for mapping potential mosquito inhabitants and locations that are prone to mosquito-borne diseases, but these methods generally do not account for species-wise identification of mosquitoes in closed-perimeter regions. Traditional methods for mosquito classification involve highly manual processes requiring tedious sample collection and supervised laboratory analysis. In this research work, we present the design and experimental validation of an automated vision-based mosquito classification module that can deploy in closed-perimeter mosquito inhabitants. The module is capable of identifying mosquitoes from other bugs such as bees and flies by extracting the morphological features, followed by support vector machine-based classification. In addition, this paper presents the results of three variants of support vector machine classifier in the context of mosquito classification problem. This vision-based approach to the mosquito classification problem presents an efficient alternative to the conventional methods for mosquito surveillance, mapping and sample image collection. Experimental results involving classification between mosquitoes and a predefined set of other bugs using multiple classification strategies demonstrate the efficacy and validity of the proposed approach with a maximum recall of 98{\%}.},

The system is constructed as follows: firstly, a yellow sticky trap is installed in the surveillance area to trap flying insects and a camera is set up to collect real-time images. Then the detection and coarse counting method based on You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection, the classification method and fine counting based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) using global features are designed. Finally, the insect counting and recognition system is implemented on Raspberry PI. Six species of flying insects including bee, fly, mosquito, moth, chafer and fruit fly are selected to assess the effectiveness of the system. Compared with the conventional methods, the test results show promising performance. The average counting accuracy is 92.50{\%} and average classifying accuracy is 90.18{\%} on Raspberry PI.

abstract = {This paper presents a method for joint stereo matching and object segmentation. In our approach a 3D scene is represented as a collection of visually distinct and spatially coherent objects. Each object is characterized by three different aspects: a color model, a 3D plane that approximates the object's disparity distribution, and a novel 3D connectivity property. Inspired by Markov Random Field models of image segmentation, we employ object-level color models as a soft constraint, which can aid depth estimation in powerful ways. In particular, our method is able to recover the depth of regions that are fully occluded in one input view, which to our knowledge is new for stereo matching. Our model is formulated as an energy function that is optimized via fusion moves. We show high-quality disparity and object segmentation results on challenging image pairs as well as standard benchmarks. We believe our work not only demonstrates a novel synergy between the areas of image segmentation and stereo matching, but may also inspire new work in the domain of automatic and interactive object-level scene manipulation.},

LBP can work robustly with respective to light variation on rich texture regions but not so efficiently on uniform regions. In the latter case, color information should overcome LBP's limitation. Due to the illumination invariance of both the LBP feature and the selected color feature, the method is able to handle local illumination changes such as cast shadows from moving objects. Due to the use of a simple layer-based strategy, the approach can model moving background pixels with quasi-periodic flickering as well as background scenes which may vary over time due to the addition and removal of long-time stationary objects. Finally, the use of a cross-bilateral filter allows to implicitly smooth detection results over regions of similar intensity and preserve object boundaries. Numerical and qualitative experimental results on both simulated and real data demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method.},

The methods are compared based on their robustness to different types of video, their memory requirements, and the computational effort they require. The impact of a Markovian prior as well as some postprocessing operators are also evaluated. Most of the videos used come from state-of-the-art benchmark databases and represent different challenges such as poor SNR, multimodal background motion, and camera jitter. Overall, we not only help to better understand for which type of videos each method best suits but also estimate how, sophisticated methods are better compared to basic background subtraction methods.},

@article{Kitchenham2009,
abstract = {Background: In 2004 the concept of evidence-based software engineering (EBSE) was introduced at the ICSE04 conference. Aims: This study assesses the impact of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) which are the recommended EBSE method for aggregating evidence. Method: We used the standard systematic literature review method employing a manual search of 10 journals and 4 conference proceedings. Results: Of 20 relevant studies, eight addressed research trends rather than technique evaluation. Seven SLRs addressed cost estimation. The quality of SLRs was fair with only three scoring less than 2 out of 4. Conclusions: Currently, the topic areas covered by SLRs are limited. European researchers, particularly those at the Simula Laboratory appear to be the leading exponents of systematic literature reviews. The series of cost estimation SLRs demonstrate the potential value of EBSE for synthesising evidence and making it available to practitioners. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.
